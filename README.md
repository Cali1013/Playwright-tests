# Playwright Tests – Personal Automation Practice

This repository contains a growing suite of end-to-end UI automation tests using [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). It's part of my hands-on learning path as I transition from manual QA leadership into technical test automation.

## What's Included

- ✅ Login, failed login, and logout flows (Herokuapp)
- ✅ Account verification and fund transfers (ParaBank)
- In-progress: Bill payment and form validation workflows

## Tools Used

- Playwright (JavaScript)
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub for version control
- Postman (for future API testing integration)
- Node.js / NPM

## Goals of This Repository

- Build reliable test flows from scratch
- Explore Playwright features like selectors, assertions, trace files
- Learn GitHub flow with `develop` as my main working branch
- Practice reusable test structure and improve technical confidence
